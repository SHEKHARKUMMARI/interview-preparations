# 1. what is execution context ?

## JavaScript Execution Context is the environment in which JavaScript code is executed

## The two main components of an execution context in JavaScript are

- <b> <h3> Memory Component (variable environment)<h3>
   <p>place where all the variables and functions are stored as key value pairs</p>

- <b> <h3> Code Component (thread of execution)<h3>

   <p>place where all the code is executed line by line and if it comes through function , it will create one more execution context</p>

  ## execution context goes though two phase in JavaScript

- <b> <h3> Creation phase<h3>
   <p> the variables and functions are stored as key value pairs</p>

- <b> <h3>Code execution phase<h3>

   <p> All the code is executed line by line</p>
