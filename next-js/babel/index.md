# What is Babel & Its Role in React/Next.js?

Babel is a JavaScript compiler that transforms modern JavaScript (ES6+) into backward-compatible code that older browsers and environments can understand. It plays a crucial role in React and Next.js applications by converting JSX and modern ES6+ features into standard JavaScript.

âœ… Converts JSX into JavaScript
âœ… Transforms ES6+ syntax (e.g., arrow functions, optional chaining) into ES5 for older browsers
âœ… Supports polyfills (via @babel/preset-env)
âœ… Works with Webpack and Next.js for optimized builds

ðŸ”¹ How Babel Works in React/Next.js?
JSX Compilation â†’ Converts JSX (<div>Hello</div>) into React.createElement().
Syntax Transformation â†’ Converts modern JS (const, let, async/await) to older syntax.
Polyfills & Plugins â†’ Adds missing browser features (like Promise, fetch).
Tree Shaking & Optimizations â†’ Removes unused code to improve performance.

ðŸ”¹ Example: JSX to JavaScript Compilation
âœ… Input (JSX)

```
const App = () => <h1>Hello, React!</h1>;
```

âœ… Babel Output (ES5)

````
"use strict";

var App = function App() {
return React.createElement("h1", null, "Hello, React!");
}; ```
This ensures the code works even in older browsers that donâ€™t support JSX.
